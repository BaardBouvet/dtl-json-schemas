TODO (requires extension)

- reformat dtl transforms and dtl snippets in merge source so each function call is wrapped and indented on new line, hops are on new lines (FracturedJson wasn't good enough)
- validate that dtl functions exist, number of arguments are correct and type of arguments are correct
- code completion to only show possible dtl functions where applicable
- code completion to only reference defined datasets
- code completion to add pipe that produces a dataset if the dataset is missing

- navigate to other rule in "apply"
- code completion to add other rule if not exists
- show list of rules in some outline and be able to jump between them?
